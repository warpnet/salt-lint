## Pull Request Process

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project. The workflow advice below mirrors [SaltStack's own guide](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/contributing.html#sending-a-github-pull-request) and is well worth reading.

1. [Fork warpnet/salt-lint](https://github.com/warpnet/salt-lint/fork) on GitHub.

2. Make a local clone of your fork.

```bash

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
