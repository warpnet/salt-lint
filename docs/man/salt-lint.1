$PWD/.saltlint -- Salt-lint checks the working directory for the presence of
this file and applies any configuration found there. The configuration file
location can also be overridden via the -c path/to/file CLI flag.

If a value is provided on both the command line and via a configuration file,
the values will be merged (if a list like exclude_paths), or the True value
will be preferred, in the case of something like quiet.
